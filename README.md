# text-a-cam
run this program on a pi and you can send it a text and receive an image from the pi camera

I recoment starting with raspbian lite

after you boot the pi for the first time run these commands

```sudo apt install git```

```cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/cTurtle98/text-a-cam.git```

```./~/text-a-cam/setup.sh```
